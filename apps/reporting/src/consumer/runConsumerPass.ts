 * `consumerBatchLimit` events is applied *and* the watermark moves past all
 * of them, atomically, or (on any error) nothing in this pass is applied
 * and the watermark is untouched — the next pass simply re-selects the
 * identical event range and retries. This is the exact property that makes
 * the watermark alone sufficient for exactly-once application, with no
 * separate per-event dedup table the way webhook_deliveries needs one.
 *

 * `FOR UPDATE`, no mutation of any outbox_events column — identical
 * posture to webhooks/dispatcher.ts's Step A.
